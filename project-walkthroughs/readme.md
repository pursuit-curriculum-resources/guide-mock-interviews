# Project Walkthroughs

After large projects, you will be tasked with completing a walkthrough with your instructor. These walkthroughs will be incorporated into your project grade and will simulate a software development interview in many ways.

## Purpose

The purpose of completing a walkthrough after a project is as follows:

- Walkthroughs allow you to synthesize and demonstrate the skills you've gained from all three threads.

- Walkthroughs provide you with the necessary practice needed for future software development interviews.

- Walkthroughs allow you to receive direct feedback and suggestions from your instructors.

Your instructor will be evaluating you during the walkthrough as if they were an outsider observer. Their goal is to give you precise and realistic feedback that will allow you to grow as a developer and professional, and best prepare you for the upcoming job search.

## Pre-work

Before a walkthrough begins, you should review your project from front to back. Take a look at the features you built, and the code you wrote, and think about the project in a more general sense. What skills and tools did the project require you to use? How do you think this project relates to the real work you'll be performing as a software developer?

You should also read through the rubric for your walkthrough and read through each of the sections below. Make sure to practice whatever you can, such as your personal pitch.

## Walkthrough overview

You will have at least 15 minutes to meet with your instructor for your walkthrough. To get the most out of it, you both will follow the schedule below.

- **(1m)** Go over the agenda and get situated.
- **(2m)** Fellow presents their _personal pitch._
- **(2m)** Fellow segues into their _project pitch._
- **(9m)** Instructor asks the Fellow to describe a specific feature, explaining their code.
- **(1m)** Fellow describes what future features they would implement on this project with more time.

For this to run smoothly, both instructors and Fellows must be well-prepared for the walkthrough. If you go over on time, instructors may be forced to end the session early and score you according to what you were able to discuss during the allotted time.

If your instructor has more than 15 minutes, they may ask additional questions about your code or features; however, all of the remaining sections should remain the same.

### Personal pitch

Once the walkthrough has begun, you will begin by giving your _personal pitch._ Your personal pitch should explain who you are and why you're excited to join the technology industry. Be specific, as doing so will allow you to make a greater impression on your interviewer. While you will be doing this with your instructor, imagine your instructor is an interviewer who has never met you before.

Below is an example of a personal pitch. You will work with your Industry Readiness and Leadership and Personal Development instructor to develop your pitch.

> My name is Melissa Wilson, and I am a former customer service representative from the healthcare industry. I joined the Pursuit program five months ago to make the transition from using software to building software. In just the few months I’ve been at Pursuit, I’ve come to love coding because it allows me to build solutions for problems I notice in the world around me. 
>
> At the moment, I’m really getting into scripting because I’ve found a lot of joy in automating simple tasks from the command line. For example, I built a script that creates a notes directory for each day of my class.

This personal pitch is rated _proficient_ because it is authentic, enthusiastic, and brief. We learn a bit about Melissa’s history and passions connected to coding. For an _exemplary_ rating, Melissa could be even more specific (e.g., what kind of problems does she notice in the world around her?) and say more about her recent interest in scripting. 

Once you've completed your pitch, you'll immediately segue to the next section on your own.

### Project pitch

Next, you should provide a project pitch that shares the problem the project intends to solve and how it solves it. The pitch does not need to include a demonstration of the application working; that will be covered in the next section.

Below is an example of a proficient project pitch. This project _was not_ a project that the Fellow created on their own; instead, it was assigned. Regardless, the Fellow has made their best attempt at putting together a narrative for the project that identifies a problem and how this application solves it.

> Today, I will be showcasing my Bird Sanctuary project. Several amazing creatures in our world are currently on the endangered species list. Personally, I don’t really find it all that motivating to donate to a general fund as opposed to knowing more about the specific creature I’m protecting.
>
> This project is designed to allow conservation-minded users to donate to protect specific birds listed on our website. It’s kind of like being able to shop around to do something good for the environment! After users donate to protect a particular bird, they’ll learn more about the bird and get regular updates on how that bird is doing. I think the fact that you can get regular updates on a specific animal makes this application different than other similar applications.

This project pitch is _proficient_ because Melissa can adequately explain what problem is being solved by the application she has created. To score _exemplary_, she may communicate how her application differs from other applications or what tasks she’s accomplished that make her application stand out.

Once you've completed your project pitch, your instructor will then begin to ask you questions about your project and your code.

### Code walk-through

In this section of the walkthrough, you will be asked to talk about your project and the code you wrote. Just like in an interview, any relevant question about your project is fair for your instructor to ask. Below are some examples of what you may be asked to explain or do.

- Can you explain in detail how your function on line 28 in this file works?

- When a user clicks this button on your page, what code executes and how does it work?

- What happens if a user submits the form on your page without entering an email address?

Your instructor may ask follow-up questions as needed. Remember, the goal of this walkthrough is to allow you to demonstrate your knowledge and replicate a software developer interview. It's also an opportunity to surface areas of growth.

### Follow-up features

Once the instructor is finished asking you questions, they will ask something like, "What would you work on next to improve this application?"

You should answer with a few follow-up features. Avoid vague answers like "improve the user experience" or "fix bugs." Instead, be specific with your features, although there's a wide range of what is acceptable. An example of a proficient answer is included below:

> Right now, the checkout process is kind of just mocked up. There’s no validation or checking for a credit card number. I’ve heard there are different APIs and services that I can use to build a real shopping cart experience. So, I think I’d like to try and work on that next, to make this application more robust and real!

## Reflect on feedback

After your walkthrough is complete and you've received your score, you may have mixed emotions depending on how you performed. This process can be really scary as you're still learning to code and may not have had a lot of practice talking about your work before this.

Take a moment to reflect on what went well and didn't go as well in your walkthrough. Choose one of your weaker areas and identify it as a skill you want to improve for your next walkthrough. And, most importantly, don't get discouraged! Your instructors and all of the Pursuit staff are here to help you as you learn and grow.
